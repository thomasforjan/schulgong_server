# :pushpin: General information

Schulgong is an innovative project aimed at simplifying school notifications and announcements. It bridges the gap between the traditional school bell system and audio announcements, providing a centralized solution for both. With the Schulgong web application, users can easily set the times for the school bell and even broadcast important announcements through network speakers. Just record the message via any device, send it, and it will be played across the school's speakers in no time. The best part? Schulgong is open-source and completely free to use.
